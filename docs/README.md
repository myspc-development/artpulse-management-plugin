1. Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
Core Module Development:

Initialize plugin lifecycle (activation/deactivation hooks).

Set up common utilities: configuration loader, validation, logging.

Create scaffolding based on the modular architecture.

2. Custom Post Types (CPT)
Register core CPTs: Events, Organizations, Artists, Artworks.

Add meta fields, REST API endpoints, and admin menus for each CPT.

Implement capability mapping for WordPress roles.

3. Membership and Access Control
Develop the Membership Module:

Manage membership tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise).

Role assignments, expiration handling, renewal logic.

Integrate Stripe for payment management.

Build the Access Control Module:

Implement role-based access control and redirection logic.

Ensure graceful handling for unauthorized access.

4. Payments & Monetization
Payments Module:

Stripe integration for memberships, add-ons, and one-time payments.

Track payment statuses, refunds, and cancellations.

Monetization features (Premium tier, digital storefront, promoted listings).

5. Organization Management
Enable creation, management, and linking of organizations.

Manage user roles within organizations.

Shared billing and centralized administrative dashboard.

6. Artists & Artworks Management
Create and manage artist profiles linked to artworks/events/organizations.

Develop comprehensive management of artwork entries with categorization, metadata, and visual assets.

7. Events Management
Implement comprehensive event management with scheduling, linking to artists/artworks, and RSVPs/ticketing system.

Provide calendar views and timeline integrations.

8. User Profile Enhancements
Extend user profiles with customizable fields and visibility settings.

Integrate with memberships, roles, organizations, and artist information.

9. Frontend & Directory Features
Shortcode-based browsable directories for organizations, events, artists, and artworks.

Implement search/filtering powered by REST API endpoints.

10. Technical Specifications & QA
Ensure PHP 8.3 compatibility, leveraging strict types and PSR-4 autoloading.

JavaScript bundling with Webpack, use ESNext standards.

Continuous integration and automated testing (unit, integration, UI) via GitHub Actions.

Optimize performance and offline capabilities with transient caching and REST API optimizations.

11. Admin & Member Help Documentation
Create admin dashboards for streamlined management.

Document clear onboarding processes for artists, organizations, and administrators.

Develop comprehensive member and admin help guides.

Recommended Next Steps:
Establish Repository and Infrastructure: Set up GitHub with Actions.

Scaffold Plugin & Core Module: Initiate the development of foundational modules.

Sequential Modular Development: Follow module priorities—Core → CPT → Membership → Access Control → Payments → Organizations → Artists/Artworks → Events.

Iterative Testing and QA: Continuous testing and integration from early stages.

Documentation and User Support: Create detailed guides alongside module implementation
